Simple, effective password database written in Python using Pycrypt. 
Encrypts passwords entered, decrypts them upon entering the main password for the database, 
and has a self-destruct function triggered by too many failed attempts.
It will create a hidden file named pass.txt and a hidden file named accounts.txt the first time you run it. 
You'll be asked to enter a main password for the database, which will be encrypted and stored in pass.txt. 
The accounts.txt will not be encrypted but will only contain the accounts' names that are stored in pass.txt. 
You have the option of viewing the accounts in case you've forgotten what you've stored in pass.txt. If you enter
your password wrong 5 times, the script will remove the pass.txt.
